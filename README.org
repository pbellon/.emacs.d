| dashboard          | nice minimalist splash screen for emacs showing recent files, projects & bookmarks     |
| evil               | Vim layer for emacs                                                                    |

| magit              | Git integration in emacs                                                               |
| neotree            | folder tree buffer similar to vim's nerdtree                                           |
| quelpa             | Git based dependencies for emacs                                                       |
| quelpa-use-package | Adds ~:quelpa~ argument to use-package function                                        |
| use-package        | All dependencies are configured with use-package                                       |
| vterm              | Better shell integration with libvterm, needs manual installation, (see install vterm) |

* Install vterm
To be use you'll need to manually build emacs-libvterm which is included in this repository as a git submodule.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git submodule update --init
#+END_SRC

Then refers to ~emacs-libvterm/README.md~ to build it. Then you should be able to use vterm inside emacs in the next configuration loading (or if you call ~reload-config~ function).
